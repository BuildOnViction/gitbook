## Get Started

Viction VRRF, which stands for Verifiable Relatively Random Function, is a random number generator that is both verifiable and provably fair. It gives smart contracts the ability to interact with random values without compromising their usefulness or security.



Viction VRRF creates a random value and cryptographic verification of how those values were obtained for each and every request that is performed. Prior to any consuming apps being able to use the evidence, it is first published and confirmed on the blockchain. Because of this procedure, the outcomes are protected from being modified or controlled by any one party, including oracle operators, miners, users, or creators of smart contracts.

\
**Verifiable**: The random number that is created by a VRRF may be verified by anybody without any difficulty. The only thing that is required of them is to examine the evidence and make sure that the hash production is accurate.

**Relatively**: As a consequence of the VRRF's usage of a portion of the output from the previous hash as an input for the subsequent request, the subsequent outcome will be unexpected; nonetheless, it will still guarantee that the correct outcome is going to be obtained.

**Random**: The output of a VRRF is completely random (uniformly dispersed) to anybody who does not know the seed or private key, and it does not follow any pattern.

**Function**: A mathematical technique is used by VRRF to generate both the random number and a proof that certifies the number's validity. This is the algorithm's function.&#x20;

## Use cases

Viction VRRF may be utilized to construct trustworthy smart contracts for any applications that are dependent on the possibility of unforeseen results:\
Responsibilities and resources are distributed at random. For instance, customer service members are assigned to any tickets or tele-sale support activities.

* By utilizing Viction VRRF, it is possible to generate distinct attributes for NFTs, adding a touch of uniqueness to the minting process. Game Studio can use this to assign a unique set of characteristics through a randomized process.
* Developers have the ability to create more enjoyable blockchain games by using random results, which are unpredictable.
* Lottery system to select winners at random. With Viction VRRF, users will be able to verify that each winner is picked using a random source that is not biased in any way.

## Cost

At Viction, we believed that the VRRF should be free and accessible to everyone. So, any user may utilize this feature to construct what they want while enjoying a frictionless journey to Web3.
