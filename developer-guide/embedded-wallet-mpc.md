# Embedded Wallet (MPC)

## Context

As Viction aims to meet the scaling needs of any dapps and pave the way for mass adoption, embedded wallets are indispensable tooling for developers to go to market faster and onboard all online users to onchain.

By using embedded wallets, Viction builders can leverage the no-code wallet tooling and be inspired to build scalable onchain applications for daily use.

## About Ramper SDK

Ramper is providing an Auth & Embedded Wallet SDK that helps developers to have non-custodial MPC wallet features natively in their onchain applications at speed with no-code integration, while allowing their users to seamlessly create/restore wallet just by signing in with Email or SSO (Gmail, Facebook, Apple ID, Telegram, Twitter, etc) - No seed phrase, no wallet app/extension download required. This enables intuitive and stay-in-app user experience, eliminating current complex Web3 onboarding that causes churn, especially for Web2 users.

Ramper ensures the decentralization of onchain applications through secure underlying Embedded Multi-Party Computation (EMPC) system where usersâ€™ secret (mnemonic) are split into three encrypted parts and stored separately in trusted environments, with neither Ramper nor the dapps able to reconstruct it.

Ramper SDK also provides the In-App WalletView component, which allows various wallet-related functionalities, including but not limited to fiat on-ramp, asset management, transaction history, asset transfers, etc.

Currently, Ramper SDK supports Next Js and will soon be supporting React Native or Unity, Cocos for games on mobile, Telegram Mini Apps.
