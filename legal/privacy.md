2.1.   General Purposes

We collect, use, disclose and process your personal data, including data provided by you, data we collect about you and data provided by third parties, in the following ways and upon the following grounds:

(a)   for the fulfillment of contractual obligations and/or transactions entered into between you and us, and to provide you with the information, or Service that you request from us;

(f)    where it is strictly necessary (i.e. to protect the vital interests of the users or other natural persons, to fulfill the purpose of public interest, or to pursue our reasonable interests);

(g)   security purposes, e.g. to monitor and detect suspicious activities, to protect users from fraudulent activities, to protect our Site, users' accounts, and archives from unauthorized access or usage, to prevent damage to our Site and systems, and to protect against automated abuse such as spam, and phishing;

(h)   communicating with you (through messages, emails,live chats or otherwise) and assisting you with your queries, requests, Site, complaints and feedback;

(i)     resolving any disputes or legal claims, investigating any complaint, claim or dispute or any actual or suspected illegal or unlawful conduct;

(n)   such purposes that may be informed to you when your personal data is collected; and/or

Subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, we shall not use or process your personal data for purposes other than the purposes stipulated in this Privacy Policy without your prior consent. Where your personal data is used for a new purpose and where required under applicable law, we shall obtain your consent. We may collect, use, disclose and process your personal data for other purposes, without your knowledge or consent, only where this is required or permitted by law.

We may, if necessary or required by law, provide your personal data to law enforcement agencies, regulatory organizations, courts or other public authorities. Where appropriate, we will attempt to notify our customers about legal demands for their personal data. You agree that we may not be able to do so if such notification is prohibited by law or court order, when the request is an emergency, or when the burden or expense of notifying the customers would be unreasonable to us. We may dispute such demands when we believe that the requests are disproportionate, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise or undertake to challenge every demand.

2.2.   Marketing purposes

In order for us, or for authorized third parties permitted by us, to market or advertise products, events, and/or Service that are of specific interest and relevance to you, we may analyze, use, process and/or rely on your personal data provided to us, or data collected from your interactions with us.

You can exercise your right to prevent such use or processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your personal data. If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS or other means) with information about goods and Service similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you, subject to your consent. If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data for marketing or advertising purposes, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only, subject to your consent.

The security of your personal data is our top priority. We shall take care in implementing and maintaining the security of our Service and Site, as well as that of your personal data. We employ procedures and policies that incorporate industry best practices to ensure the integrity of your personal data and to prevent instances of unauthorized use.

&#x20;

Please note that it is impossible to fully guarantee the security of your personal data. While we take reasonable steps to safeguard your personal data in our possession or under our control, you agree not to hold us liable or responsible for any loss or damage resulting from any unauthorized or unintended access that is beyond our control (e.g. hacking or cybercrimes), or abuse of your information. We recommend that you take independent safety precautions to protect your personal data, particularly your credential information such as your username and password. You hereby agree that we shall not be liable for any information leakage and other losses not caused intentionally or otherwise by our gross negligence, including, but not limited to, hacker attacks, power interruptions, or unavoidable technical failures. For the avoidance of doubt, we do not make any warranty, guarantee, or representation that your use of our systems or Site is safe and protected from malware, and other vulnerabilities. We also do not guarantee the security of data that you choose to send us electronically. Sending such data is entirely at your own risk.

3.2.   For how long will your data be stored?

We will process and store your personal data for as long as it is necessary in order to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, and to satisfy our business, contractual, legal, regulatory and/or statutory obligations (including audit, accounting or reporting purposes). We may thus be required to retain certain information, including personal data or information of users, users' profiles, identification verification materials, information relevant to AML/KYC/CTF procedures, account information, account agreements, and other agreements between us and third parties, account statements, and other records, for an extended period of time.

We will assess and respond to requests to delete personal data and we shall accordingly delete personal data provided that the personal data is no longer required in order to fulfill our business, contractual, legal, regulatory and/or statutory obligations, or the fulfillment of any obligations to preserve records according to applicable laws and regulations.

In general, how long we keep your personal data depends on the nature of the data, e.g. we keep personal data for at least the duration of the limitation period for bringing claims if the personal data may be required to commence or defend legal proceedings. Some information may also be retained for longer e.g. where we are required to do so by law.

3.3.   Anonymized data

In some circumstances we may anonymize and/or aggregate your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we are entitled to retain and use such data without restriction.

4\.        Disclosure of your personal data&#x20;

Your personal data may be made available, disclosed or shared to our related parties and/or within our group of companies in order to provide our Service or Site to you, for management and compliance purposes, and to utilize shared group IT functions.

(m)  other circumstances under which we may disclose your personal data such as:

&#x20;                        i.         to comply, as necessary, with applicable laws and regulatory requirements;

&#x20;                       ii.         respond to mandatory legal or governmental requests or demands for information;

You may freely opt-out of having your personal data shared with third parties (or for any of the above listed purposes), or from allowing us to use your personal data for any purpose that is incompatible with the purposes for which we originally collected or subsequently obtained your authorization as stipulated in this Privacy Policy. Please contact us if you wish to opt-out.

We will ensure that all companies and/or third parties to whom we disclose your personal data will only process it in accordance with our instructions and on our behalf. We will, where appropriate and permissible, enter into contracts with these third parties to protect your personal data in a manner that is consistent with all applicable laws. All such companies and third parties will be required by us to meet the requirements of applicable data protection legislation and our strict privacy and retention policies to keep your personal data secure at all times.
