TERMS OF SERVICE

Last Revision Date: **December 06, 2023**

&#x20;1\.          Introduction

This Terms of Service (“Terms”) is a binding contract between you, an individual user or site visitor, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“user”, “you”, “your”) and Tomo Foundation (the “Foundation”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) concerning use of the Foundation’s Service  (the “Service”), including the https://www.viction.xyz/ website as well as any other media form, media channel, or mobile website related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site”). Currently, the Foundation maintains and operates https://www.viction.xyz/ as a portal for news, information, and updates about the Viction blockchain (formerly Tomochain) (the “Viction Blockchain”) and the Viction ecosystem. For the avoidance of doubt, the Foundation does not control Viction Blockchain and cannot control activity and data on Viction Blockchain, the activities of persons who develop and/or use applications on Viction Blockchain, the validation of transactions on Viction Blockchain, or the use of Viction Blockchain. Viction Blockchain is an open-source protocol that is maintained and processed by Viction Blockchain validators across the globe.

We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding which is subject to this indemnification upon becoming aware of it.

&#x20;

12\.       Limitation of Liability

In no event will the Foundation Parties or their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, sub-contractors, affiliates or agents be liable to you or any third party for any direct, indirect, consequential, exemplary, statutory, incidental, special, or punitive damages, including lost profit, lost revenue, loss of data, costs, expenses and payments, either in tort (including negligence), contract, or other damages, in any other form, arising from, or in connection with, your use of the Site, the inability to use the Site, the Site features, marketing of the Site or the Site features, or any form of failure, error, or breakdown in use of the Site, from any fault, or error made by the Foundation Parties, or from your reliance on content available on the Site, or from any communication through the Site, or with other users on the Site, or from any denial or cancellation of your user account, or from retention, deletion, disclosure and any other use or loss of your content on the Site, even if the Foundation Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Foundation Parties’ aggregate liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to U.S$100. Certain international laws do not allow limitations on implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply to you, some or all of the above disclaimers or limitations may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.

&#x20;

13\.       Governing Law

These Terms and your access to and use of the Service shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines without [giving](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/giving) [effect](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/effect) to the [conflict of laws](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/conflict-of-laws) [principles](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/principles) thereof.

&#x20;

14\.       Dispute Resolution

We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against the Foundation Parties, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim by email at \<support@viction.xyz>. The notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your online account and will contain the information described above. If we can’t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party may initiate a formal proceeding.

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Foundation Parties and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

You and Foundation Parties agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, or our Service is personal to you and Foundation Parties and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.

Except for claims disputes in which you or Foundation Parties seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, you and Foundation Parties waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Service including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. All Disputes shall be submitted to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) to be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings shall be conducted virtually. You and Foundation Parties agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the SIAC Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“SIAC Rules”). The most recent version of the SIAC Rules is incorporated into these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the SIAC Rules or waive your opportunity to read the SIAC Rules and waive any claim that the SIAC Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, Foundation Parties, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments, and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Foundation Parties will not have the right to assert the claim.

If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall stay pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable.

&#x20;

15\.       Termination

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time in connection with any transaction as required by applicable law, any governmental authority, or if we in our sole and reasonable discretion determine you are violating these Term or the terms of any third-party service provider at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you. Such suspension or termination shall not constitute a breach of these Terms by Foundation Parties. In accordance with its anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-fraud, and other compliance policies and practices, we may impose reasonable limitations and controls on the ability of you or any beneficiary to utilize the Service. Such limitations may include where good cause exists, rejecting transaction requests, freezing funds, or otherwise restricting you from using the Service.

Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of the Services, the following Sections will survive: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

&#x20;

16\.       Severability

If any term, clause, or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause, or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause, or provision, or any other term, clause, or provision of these Terms.

17\.       Injunctive Relief

You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to the Foundation for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and the Foundation shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security, or proof of damages.

18\.       Miscellaneous

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Foundation relating to your access to and use of the Service. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of the Foundation, and the Foundation’ failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect.

Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
