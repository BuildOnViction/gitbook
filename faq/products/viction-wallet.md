Every wallet consists of two parts - public key and private key. Viction Wallet stores your private key and passphrase directly on your device. There are a couple of formats Viction can display your private key in:

* Private key - an unencrypted collection of numbers and letters that unlocks access to your address on various blockchains
* Passphrase - 12 words used to secure your private key. Much easier to remember.

No service should ever ask you for your private key or passphrase. Anyone with your private key/passphrase can access your wallet and have FULL CONTROL of your funds.
