## **General Questions**

### **What is VicScan?**

[VicScan](https:/vicscan.xyz/) is a block explorer for Viction. It is pretty similar to EtherScan used on the Ethereum network if you are already familiar with it.

VicScan provides a user-friendly interface to explore the Viction blockchain. From a user perspective, VicScan provides transparency because all block information, transactions, finality, smart contracts, Dapps and token information are read from Viction and displayed here. Furthermore, VicScan offers technical visualisations and useful statistics about Viction performance, token holders and other functionalities.

### **What is a TxHash? How to check a TxHash?**

TxHash stands for 'transaction hash', and is also known as a transaction ID.

An example of what a TxHash looks like: `0xedab9e59d4567e9ced8d61caefe20e1e2a3fe95cceaaeabc98466ef3f03c0eca`

To check a TxHash, follow the steps below:
