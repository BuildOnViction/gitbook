# Viction

Viction is a people-centric blockchain, offering zero-gas transactions and enhanced security to make Web3 easy and safe for everyone. Now with Viction World Wide Chain, we provide a novel solution representing a network of app chains that operate concurrently, anchored by a common settlement on Viction. Build, own, win, and be part of Viction World Wide Chain where everyone scales beyond limits.

With a network of 150 masternodes utilizing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, Viction touts its scalability and stability. It employs advanced techniques like double validation, smart contract staking, and proper randomization to enhance security and chain finality. Viction supports all EVM-compatible smart contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers.

Viction is driven by a mission to build a decentralized platform that empowers humanity to connect, collaborate, and create without limitations, envisioning a world where transparency, accessibility, and growth thrive. Thatâ€™s why we introduced Viction World Wide Chain.&#x20;

Viction World Wide Chain provides a novel solution, representing a network of app chains that operate concurrently, anchored by a common settlement on Viction. These fractal-like chains are interconnected through Viction World Wide Chain Protocol (WWCP), allowing for fluid asset and data transfer within these chains, and establishing a foundation for extensive scalability and a myriad of decentralized applications

And Viction Data Availability (Viction DA), a component of the Viction World Wide Chain. This innovation promises to revolutionize the blockchain space by boosting scalability, flexibility, and interoperability, paving the way for Web3 builders to build blockchain applications primed for global uptake.

The seamless integration of Viction DA with other rollup stacks facilitates fluid data communications and transfers, boosting shared liquidity and empowering developers with the confidence to innovate within the Viction World Wide Chain network. This strong infrastructure not only propels the growth of the Viction World Wide Chain but also cultivates a dynamic ecosystem where developers can innovate confidently and users benefit from a broader range of secure, interconnected applications.
