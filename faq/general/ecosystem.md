# Ecosystem

## **What are the incentives for partners and Dapp developers to build on Viction?**

Building on Viction isn't just about leveraging advanced blockchain technology—it's about thriving in a supportive and vibrant ecosystem. Here’s how we empower our partners and developers with our holistic support:

### The win-for-all technical core

* **Scalability and Performance:** Viction's technical infrastructure, powered by the Proof of Staked Vote (PoSV) mechanism, supports up to 150 masternodes, ensuring high throughput and reliable performance. This structure allows for a fair distribution of block rewards and a double-validation process that enhances the security and consistency of block production​&#x20;
* **Innovative Features and Integration Capabilities:** With cross-chain interoperability through the Viction World Wide Chain, developers can create more flexible and interconnected applications. This integration capability allows applications on Viction to seamlessly interact with other blockchains, expanding the potential use cases and user reach.
* **Zero Gas Fee Transactions:** A standout feature of Viction is the elimination of gas fees through the VRC25 token standard. This approach not only lowers the barrier for new users and developers but also significantly reduces the operational cost of running applications on the blockchain
* **Data Availability Powered by Viction DA:** This will support the scalability of the blockchain. By ensuring data is readily available and accessible, Viction helps maintain the efficiency and speed of transactions across the network, which is critical for applications that require high throughput and rapid processing times.
* **Security and Decentralization:** Viction prioritizes a secure and decentralized network. This focus not only enhances the safety of deployed applications but also aligns with the ethos of blockchain technology—promoting a decentralized and user-empowered framework.
* **Developer-Friendly Tools:** Viction provides a range of tools and resources that simplify the development process. From comprehensive documentation to active community support and developer incentives, Viction aims to lower the barrier to entry for new developers and support the ongoing projects of experienced developers.
* **Supportive Community and Ecosystem:** The Viction community offers a supportive network for developers, including forums, technical support, and regular updates. This community-driven approach helps foster innovation and collaboration among developers, enhancing the overall ecosystem.
