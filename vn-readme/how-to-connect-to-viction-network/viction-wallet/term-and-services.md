1. Introduction

These Terms of Service (“Terms”), which can be viewed as an agreement between an individual or entity user or authorized representative of such user (“you”, “your”, “user”) and Viction Labs, LLC (“Viction Wallet”, “we”, “us”, “our”), govern your access and use of all versions of the App (as defined below) and the Services (as defined below). The App makes certain software services accessible to users via an unhosted mobile device application and browser extension marketed, advertised, or marked by us with the name “Viction Wallet” from time to time (the “App”).

By accessing the App and/or using any or all the Services, you accept and agree to be legally bound by these Terms and all the terms incorporated herein by reference.

Viction Wallet reserves the right to modify or replace any of these Terms in its sole discretion from time to time. The “Date Last Revised” specified on these Terms indicates the date on which the Terms were last modified. Please check these Terms periodically to ensure that you are aware of and in compliance with the most current version of these Terms. Any revision to the Terms shall take effect immediately upon such revised Terms being made accessible via the Services. Such revised Terms shall be binding on you, and by your continued access and/or use of the App for purposes of participating in the Services, you shall be deemed to agree to and accept the Terms as revised.

THE APP IS DEVELOPED AND PROVIDED ON AN “AS-IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS BY VICTION WALLET AND/OR ITS AFFILIATES, AND VICTION WALLET AND ITS AFFILIATES (SAVE TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAWS) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND IN RESPECT THEREOF. IF YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT AS TO THE ACTION YOU SHOULD TAKE, YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR LEGAL, FINANCIAL, TAX AND/OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISOR(S). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, OR PARTICIPATE IN THE SERVICES, AND MUST CANCEL YOUR ACCESS IMMEDIATELY.

1. In these Terms, the following words, and expressions, whenever used in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings indicated below:

“Digital Asset” means any digital asset (including a virtual currency or virtual commodity) which is a digital representation of value based on (or built on top of) a cryptographic protocol of a computer network.

“Law” means the laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, judgments, injunctions, orders, and decrees of any governmental authority.

“Viction” (formerly “Tomochain") is a scalable blockchain powered via Proof-of-Stake Voting (PoSV) consensus, in mainnet since 2018, taking a community-driven approach to accelerate the mass adoption of web3 applications. Information about Viction is available on its official website <[https://viction.xyz/](https://viction.xyz/)>.

“Services” means the services that may be provided by us as defined in Section 4.

“Wallet” means a digital storage component provided by the App, encompassing both the native wallets generated by the App and third-party wallets that can be imported and accessed within the App, for storing, managing, and facilitating transactions involving your Digital Assets stored on the blockchain(s) supported by the App.

2. Acknowledgement of Risk: As with any asset, the value of Digital Assets can increase or decrease and there can be a substantial risk that you lose money buying, selling, holding, or investing in Digital Assets. You should consult your financial advisor, legal or tax professional regarding your specific situation and financial condition and carefully consider whether trading or holding Digital Assets is suitable for you.

Viction Wallet is not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and does not offer securities services in the United States or to U.S. persons. You acknowledge that Digital Assets are not subject to protections or insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.

3. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE: WE DO NOT PROVIDE INVESTMENT OR FINANCIAL ADVICE OR CONSULTING SERVICES. WE ARE SOLELY THE PROVIDER OF VICTION WALLET AND WE DO NOT ADVISE OR MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT ENGAGING IN DIGITAL ASSET TRANSACTIONS OR OPERATIONS. DECISIONS TO ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS OR PERFORM OPERATIONS INVOLVING DIGITAL ASSETS SHOULD BE TAKEN ON YOUR OWN ACCORD.
4. Wallet Registration and Security

You must either import or create a Wallet in order to use Viction Wallet. When you create a Wallet, you will be assigned a private key. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your private key or any other breach of security of your Wallet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that you shall assume all risks related to the use of the Services and you shall be solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your private key. When you create a Wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your Wallet. Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) creating a strong unique password that you do not use for any other purpose (i.e. different to your phone password or any other passwords you use for websites, online services, etc.) and leveraging biometric authentication if available; (b) do not store the private key and Secret Phrase in plain text online or in an unsecured physical location; (c) limiting access to your devices and your Wallet; (d) taking all necessary precautions against malware on your devices and networks; and (e) promptly notifying us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with activities that occur on your Wallet with or without your authorization.

2. Payment and Fees

We may charge fees for some or part of the Services we make available to you. We reserve the right to change those fees at our discretion. Fees applicable to the Services or any component of the Services, if any, shall be set forth or displayed in the App from time to time.

You may incur charges from third parties for use of linked services. For example, you may be charged fees via the DApps and/or DEXs that you may access via the App.

3. Transaction Fees

There may be transaction fees (e.g. mining fees) associated with your virtual currency transactions that are required by Viction or any other blockchain network with which the Services are compatible. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your Wallet and/or “gas” to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions or losses you incur due to incorrectly set transaction fees (i.e. too low or too high) or due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your Wallet address. You further acknowledge and agree that we do not have access to your or anyone else’s transactions.

4. Taxes

It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions that you have submitted transaction details for via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Digital Asset-related transactions.

5. Ownership and Control

You own and control Digital Assets held in your Wallet. As the sole owner of digital assets in your Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such digital assets. Viction Wallet shall have no liability for digital asset fluctuations or loss associated with your use of the App. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your Digital Assets by sending it to a different blockchain address.

3. Authority/Terms of Service

2. Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities

An encrypted backup of certain information associated with your Wallet can be stored on eligible devices. The private key is associated with the Wallet address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Digital Assets to and from that Wallet address. You are solely responsible for the retention and security of your private key and any mnemonic phrase (“Secret Phrase”) associated with your Wallet. Your Secret Phrase is the only way to access the Digital Assets associated with your Wallet. Anyone that has access to your Secret Phrase can access your Digital Assets. You must keep your Wallet address, Secret Phrase, and private key access information secure. It is very important that you backup your private keys, backup phrases or passwords. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Digital Assets associated with your Wallet. You acknowledge and agree that we do not receive or store your Wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or Secret Phrase associated with your Wallet. We cannot generate a new password for your Wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Digital Assets you have associated with such Wallet address will become inaccessible. You agree that Viction Wallet and its affiliates shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever in the event you are unable to access your Wallet for any reason including without limitation your failure to keep your Wallet address, Secret Phrase and private key information secure.

3. Use of Third Party Materials

If you access or use DApps or DEX, including, without limitation, DApp functionality embedded within the Services such as the trade/swap Digital Assets function (“Third Party Materials”), you acknowledge and agree that:

1. Viction Wallet makes no warranties or representations, express or implied, about such linked Third Party Materials, the third parties they are owned and operated by, the information contained on them, the suitability of their products or services, or the assets they make accessible;
2. Viction Wallet is not responsible for your access or use of Third Party Materials and shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with your use of Third Party Materials, including, without limitation, any transactions you dispute;
3. the limits of amounts that you may exchange via Third Party Materials per day shall be subject to any requirements of the third-party developed smart contracts;
4. blockchain operations are irrevocable meaning when you conduct any transactions via Third Party Materials, you shall be solely responsible for the consequences of any issues associated with such transactions, including, without limitation, your transfer to an incorrect address or problems associated with the node servers selected by you;
5. when you use Third Party Materials, third-party developed smart contracts may charge you handling fees and/or service fees and any information displayed on Viction Wallet relating to such fees are for your reference only as Viction Wallet cannot and does not guarantee its accuracy, applicability, reliability, integrity or appropriateness, nor shall Viction Wallet be liable for any loss or damage that may be caused directly or indirectly by your use of these contents; and
6. Viction Wallet may, in its discretion, charge such fees at any time in the future. Any updated fees will apply to any transaction that occurs following the effective date of the updated fees.
7. Use of Staking Service

If you access or use the Staking Service, a third party may stake certain Digital Assets on your behalf (“Staked Digital Assets”), acting as a transaction validator on Viction or any other blockchain network supported by the App. If a block of transactions is successfully validated using such Staked Digital Assets, a reward is granted by that network (“Staking Reward”). You acknowledge and agree that Viction Wallet is not responsible for: (i) your use of the Staking Service and shall have no liability whatsoever in connection with your use of the Staking Service; (ii) ensuring Staking will occur continuously; and (iii) ensuring any particular Digital Asset will be staked or will continue to be staked.

5. Digital Asset Transactions

In order for all proposed Digital Asset transactions to be completed, they must be confirmed and recorded in Viction or Digital Asset’ associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the blockchain networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) we do not have the ability to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction; (ii) the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the applicable blockchain networks; (iii) we do not store, send, or receive Digital Assets; and (iv) any transfer that occurs in relation to any Digital Asset occurs on the relevant blockchain network and not on a network owned by us and therefore we do not guarantee the transfer of title or right in any Digital Asset.

6. Accuracy of Information Provided by User

You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Digital Asset transaction initiated via the Services. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Digital Asset.

5. You accept and acknowledge
6. The prices and liquidity of cryptocurrency assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the Digital Assets made available through the Services, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that you will not lose money and have no responsibility to you for any such loss.
7. There are risks associated with using an internet-based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your Wallet. You accept and acknowledge that Viction Wallet will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Services for transactions, however caused.
8. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and digital assets is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Services.
9. The Services may rely on third-party apps to perform transactions with respect to any digital assets. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such app providers; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such app providers change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such apps; or if any of such apps loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Services will suffer.
10. You further acknowledge and accept the risk that your Digital Assets, or any Digital Assets you acquire, including through a third-party exchange may lose some or all of their value and you may suffer loss due to the fluctuation of prices of Digital Assets and/or significant price slippage and cost. You understand that anyone can create a Digital Asset, including fake versions of existing Digital Assets and Digital Asset that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other Digital Asset. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks and that we cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Services.

15. Future changes to the App

We are always working to improve the App, so our products and Services may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of Viction Wallet, or we may introduce new features or impose limitations on certain features or restrict access to part or all the App.

16. Resolving Disputes; Binding Arbitration

We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Viction Wallet, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim by email at \<support@viction.xyz>. The notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your online account and will contain the information described above. If we can’t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party may initiate a formal proceeding.

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Viction Wallet and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

1. No Representative Actions. You and Viction Wallet agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, or our Services is personal to you and Viction Wallet and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.
2. Arbitration of Disputes. Except for claims disputes in which you or Viction Wallet seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, you and Viction Wallet waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. All Disputes shall be submitted to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) to be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings shall be conducted virtually. You and Viction Wallet agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the SIAC Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“SIAC Rules”). The most recent version of the SIAC Rules is incorporated into these Terms by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the SIAC Rules or waive your opportunity to read the SIAC Rules and waive any claim that the SIAC Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
3. The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, Viction Wallet, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments, and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality doesn’t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
4. Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Viction Wallet will not have the right to assert the claim.
5. If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall stay pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable.
6. Governing Law

These Terms and your access to and use of the Services shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines without [giving](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/giving) [effect](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/effect) to the [conflict of laws](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/conflict-of-laws) [principles](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/principles) thereof.

18. Termination

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time in connection with any transaction as required by applicable law, any governmental authority, or if we in our sole and reasonable discretion determine you are violating these Terms or the terms of any third-party Services provider at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you. Such suspension or termination shall not constitute a breach of these Terms by Viction Wallet. In accordance with its anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-fraud, and other compliance policies and practices, we may impose reasonable limitations and controls on the ability of you or any beneficiary to utilize the Services. Such limitations may include where good cause exists, rejecting transaction requests, freezing funds, or otherwise restricting you from using the Services.

You may disconnect your Wallet at any time. You acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation to you in such an event and that you will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts that you have already paid to us or any third party, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Upon any termination, discontinuation, or cancellation of the Services, the following Sections will survive: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21.

19. Severability

If any term, clause, or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause, or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause, or provision, or any other term, clause, or provision of these Terms.

20. Injunctive Relief

You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to Viction Wallet for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and Viction Wallet shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security, or proof of damages.

21. Miscellaneous

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Viction Wallet relating to your access to and use of the Service. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of Viction Wallet, and Viction Wallet’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect.

Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
