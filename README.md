# Getting Started

* **For Voters/Stakers**: Staking on Viction[ Masternodes](https://master.Viction.com/) secures the network and earns rewards. More information can be in our guide on [how to connect wallets to ](https://docs.Viction.com/general/how-to-connect-to-Viction-network)Viction and [how to vote](https://youtu.be/tXp4WHl\_sxY).
* **For Masternode Owners**: 150 Masternodes work to secure the entire Viction ecosystem. Each Masternode is a server that uses its computing power to create and sign blocks. For this contribution, Masternodes receive rewards in the form of VIC. A Masternode must satisfy [minimum system requirements](masternode/requirements.md) in computing power, RAM, and storage to stably maintain the network. A financial requirement of 50,000 VIC is needed to [apply](masternode/apply-your-node.md) to become a Masternode Candidate. Masternode owners should carefully read our dedicated guide to [running a Masternode](masternode/run-a-full-node/), using [tmn](masternode/run-a-full-node/tmn.md) and [Docker](masternode/run-a-full-node/docker.md), along with our [tutorial](https://medium.com/Viction/how-to-run-a-Viction-masternode-from-a-to-z-3793752dc3d1) on the Viction Medium page and [wiki page](https://github.com/Viction/docs/wiki).
* **For Developers**: To support the development of Viction's ecosystem growth, we are maintaining a set of tutorials and documents on developing Dapps to be run on Viction. This [Dapp tutorial ](https://docs.Viction.com/developer-guide/building-dapp-on-Viction)shows how to deploy a smart contract on Viction. For developers who are curious about Viction's source code, this [private Viction testnet](https://docs.Viction.com/developer-guide/working-with-Viction/Viction-private-testnet-setup) guides how to set up a private Viction testnet.
