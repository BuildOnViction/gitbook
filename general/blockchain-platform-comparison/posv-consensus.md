  Viction uses an innovative consensus method called Proof-of-Stake Voting which
  provides an incentive to all VIC holders to play an active part in staking
  across a network of 150 Masternodes.

# PoSV Consensus

### Overview

Viction is an EVM-compatible blockchain powered by the scalable Proof-of-Stake Voting consensus mechanism that allows every Ethereum smart contract to run with almost instant transaction confirmation. 150 Masternodes secure the Viction blockchain and allow for the following:

* Token holders deposit 50,000 VIC to become a Masternode Candidate
* Token holders vote for Masternode Candidates
* Most voted Candidates are selected as Masternodes
* Masternodes create blocks in a round-robin and use double validation to prevent collusion
* Masternodes finalizing blocks are incentivized

**High Performance**

Massive acceleration of blockchain performance is one of the most important key features of the Viction public chain. With the PoSV consensus protocol, the Viction network provides:

* At least 2,000 TPS while still enhancing security through Double Validation
* 2-second block time and transaction confirmed within 4 seconds

### Double Validation

Double validation provides a trustworthy validation layer for security enhancement through provable uniform distribution decentralized randomization. Specifically, when a Masternode creates a block, it must be verified by another Masternode that is randomly selected among the set of Masternodes before being added to the blockchain. Double validation strengthens Victionâ€™s security, and reduces the risk of forks, and nothing-at-stake attacks, making Viction unique among Proof-of-Stake based blockchains.
