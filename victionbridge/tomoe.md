### 1. What is TOMOE?

VIC-wrapped ETH, called TOMOE, is an ERC20 token hosted on the Ethereum blockchain and backed by an equal amount of native VIC (on the Viction blockchain). One TOMOE is worth the same as one native VIC at any given moment.

### 3. How to Convert TOMOE > VIC

* **Using SpaceGate**&#x20;

In order to use the cross-chain bridges, you need to pay several types of fees as follows: protocol fees, bridging fees (withdraw fee), and network fees (which are charged in the father token of each blockchain such as ETH for TOMOE ERC20). Please check further details on the fees[ here](https://docs.coin98.com/products/spacegate/faqs?ref=blog.coin98.com).

Viction always wants to make sure all the transactions are secured. Therefore, each asset will have a limit on the number of tokens in a single conversion transaction

\- For VIC, you can convert a minimum of 10 VIC and a maximum of 5,000 per transaction
