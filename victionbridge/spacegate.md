{% hint style="info" %}
* In order to use the cross-chain bridges, you need to pay several types of fees as follows: protocol fees, bridging fees (withdraw fee), and network fees (which are charged in the father token of each blockchain such as BNB for converting C98 Bep20 to others, ETH for C98 ERC20, SOL for C98 SPL, and MATIC for C98 PRC20). Please check further details on the fees[**here**](https://docs.coin98.com/products/spacegate/faqs?ref=blog.coin98.com).
* Each asset will have a limit on the number of tokens in a single conversion transaction\
  \- For C98, you can convert a minimum of **10 C98** and a maximum of **50,000 C98** per transaction\
  \- For VIC, you can convert a minimum of **10 VIC** and a maximum of **5,000** per transaction

## What is TOMOE?

VIC-wrapped ETH, called TOMOE, is an ERC20 token hosted on the Ethereum blockchain and backed by an equal amount of native VIC (on the Viction blockchain). One TOMOE is worth the same as one native VIC at any given moment.
